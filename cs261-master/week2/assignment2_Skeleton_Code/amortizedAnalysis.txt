1. How many cost units are spent in the entire process of performing 40 consecutive push operations on an empty array which starts out
at capacity 8, assuming that the array will double in capacity each time a new item is added to an already full dynamic array? 
As N (ie. the number of pushes) grows large, under this strategy for resizing, what is the average big-oh complexity for a push?

12345678910
1111111191 = 18

1234567 8910
11111117111 = 26

12345678910
1111111111 = 10

123 45678910
11331111111 = 42 

total = 96 units

average time complexity: O(1+)

2. How many cost units are spent in the entire process of performing 40 consecutive push operations on an empty array which starts out
at capacity 8, assuming that the array will grow by a constant 2 spaces each time a new item is added to an already full dynamic
array? As N (ie. the number of pushes) grows large, under this strategy for resizing, what is the average big-oh complexity for a
push?

total = 408 units
Looks to be around O(N/4) time complexity so average time complexity is: O(N)
